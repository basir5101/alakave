It is also evident for producers who keep some incredible vintages and lack space; they can now list them on alakave so that other enthusiasts will undoubtedly enjoy them... This marketplace project has been dear to us for several years.

Be fair, say it, be careful about the prices you ask. No one is safe from selling or buying a corked wine, for example. This happens in the best wine merchants, in the best productions. These are things that happen and no one is responsible. If this happens to you, talk calmly with your interlocutor and try to find an amicable solution, together. It is equally important to explain where the bottle came from and how you stored it. On the other side of the screen there are men and women like you who do not want to regret this meeting, even virtual. They also go down alakave to get a bottle, they too are passionate. Get inspired by our guide to know the best vintages by region. Do not hesitate to offer batches of three bottles if it allows to base the transport prices. Exchange with each other on the messaging, dialogue and above all do not cheat. We will not hesitate to exclude members who do not respect these codes of conduct. We close the account and let the whole community know. In addition, we are completely transparent with the legal authorities that request us"

And obviously, the wine is no longer good if it tastes like Madeira, a rancid taste.</p><br/><p>It may seem surprising that wine is no exception in terms of consumer rights. It is indeed considered a `product`, so there may be a need for `repair`. The problem is that after opening, it’s quite delicate!</p> <br/> <p>It is difficult to know if a wine is objectively corked or simply disappointing. Whether you buy wine from a winegrower, a merchant or a restaurant, the behaviour to adopt is a mixture of common sense and diplomacy.</p> <br/> <p>Without a commercial invoice, the 'legal guarantee for lack of conformity' on which one would rely to return a washing machine to the merchant, is difficult to invoke.</p> <br/><p>On ALAKAVE, we are among trusted members.
